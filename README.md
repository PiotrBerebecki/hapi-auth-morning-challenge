# hapi.js Authentication - Morning Challenge

Clone this repo & have a look at the files you already have.

## Exercise 1

1. Install `hapi-auth-basic` and add register this plugin on your server.

2. Write a function called `basicValidate`, which validates the user in your "database" (we are just using a JavaScript object for the purposes of this exercise)

3. Replace the comment in `server.js` with an authentication strategy that uses `hapi-auth-basic`
